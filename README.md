This R script visualizes the results from a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of Cellular Components (CC). The script uses the ggplot2 package to create a scatter plot, where the x-axis represents the Odds Ratio, the y-axis displays the GO terms, and point colors indicate the P-values, with a gradient from red to blue. The size of the points corresponds to the Count of each term. The plot is customized with a clean theme_bw background, and labels for the x-axis, y-axis, and title are set accordingly. The visualization helps in understanding the distribution and significance of various GO terms based on their odds ratio and count.
